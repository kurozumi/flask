"To define your models, just subclass the `Document` class that is "
"imported from MongoKit.  If you've seen the SQLAlchemy pattern you may "
"wonder why we do not have a session and even do not define a `init_db` "
"function here.  On the one hand, MongoKit does not have something like a "
"session.  This sometimes makes it more to type but also makes it "
"blazingly fast.  On the other hand, MongoDB is schemaless.  This means "
"you can modify the data structure from one insert query to the next "
"without any problem.  MongoKit is just schemaless too, but implements "
"some validation to ensure data integrity."

"This example shows you how to define your schema (named structure), a "
"validator for the maximum character length and uses a special MongoKit "
"feature called `use_dot_notation`.  Per default MongoKit behaves like a "
"python dictionary but with `use_dot_notation` set to ``True`` you can use"
" your documents like you use models in nearly any other ORM by using dots"
" to separate between attributes."
